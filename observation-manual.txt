seconds_after_rat_arrival is the difference between rat_start_time and start_time, we observed that rats are usually on the platform first.
Risk-reward analysis, see wether taking the risk was rewarding to the bats or not

The recording is recording 24/7, we can know the time of recording by checking the time stamps, the 2 datasets are not separate at all.

from the second dataset we can see how many rats were present

we can check if the rats won the food or not based on if the reward is 0 and the food was reduced, it means the rats ate it.

We concluded from the records in dataset1, and the batlandings in dataset 2 that dataset one is only a sample not a population

every record in table one will have a record in table 2, not every record in table 2 will have a record in table 1


# when connecting between 2 datasets(dataset1_sorted, dataset2), we'll check the start_time in table 1 and join it with  record it is in in table 2 (time)
# add record "rat_period_end" we'll check where it is in time in table 2, if it's the same record, we'll not do anything, if it is in a different record in table 2, we will also join it
# every column we take from table 2 we'll add it as a column in table 1 for each of these columns: bat_landing_number,food_availability,rat_minutes,rat_arrival_number as a new column in table 1. and a duplicate record for them in case we take 2 record:  bat_landing_number2,food_availability2,rat_minutes2,rat_arrival_number2
# example table 1 after joining the 2 datasets: start_time,bat_landing_to_food,habit,rat_period_start,rat_period_end,seconds_after_rat_arrival,risk,reward,month,sunset_time,hours_after_sunset,season,bat_landing_number,food_availability,rat_minutes,rat_arrival_number,bat_landing_number2,food_availability2,rat_minutes2,rat_arrival_number2

-(order the first dataset based on time)    
-(we will take the records from dataset2 and connect them to the records in dataset1 based on the start time and the time of recording, if the durating (start time and bat landing) comes between 2 recordings, we will take the two records )
