seconds_after_rat_arrival is the difference between rat_start_time and start_time, we observed that rats are usually on the platform first.
Risk-reward analysis, see wether taking the risk was rewarding to the bats or not

The recording is recording 24/7, we can know the time of recording by checking the time stamps, the 2 datasets are not separate at all.

from the second dataset we can see how many rats were present

we can check if the rats won the food or not based on if the reward is 0 and the food was reduced, it means the rats ate it.

We concluded from the records in dataset1, and the batlandings in dataset 2 that dataset one is only a sample not a population

every record in table one will have a record in table 2, not every record in table 2 will have a record in table 1
