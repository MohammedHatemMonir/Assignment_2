The null hypothesis is that rat presence has no effect on bat avoidance or vigilance.

seconds_after_rat_arrival is the difference between rat_start_time and start_time, from dataset1 we observed that rats are usually on the platform first.
Risk-reward analysis, see wether taking the risk was rewarding to the bats or not

The recording is recording 24/7, we can know the time of recording by checking the time stamps, the 2 datasets are not separate at all.

from the second dataset we can see how many rats were present

We concluded from the records in dataset1, and the batlandings in dataset 2 that dataset one is only a sample not a population because of the amount of bat landings in every record

every record in table one will have a record in table 2, not every record in table 2 will have a record in table 1


# when connecting between 2 datasets(dataset1_sorted, dataset2), we'll check the start_time in table 1 and join it with  record it is in in table 2 (time)
# add record "rat_period_end" we'll check where it is in time in table 2, if it's the same record, we'll not do anything, if it is in a different record in table 2, we will also join it
# every column we take from table 2 we'll add it as a column in table 1 for each of these columns: bat_landing_number,food_availability,rat_minutes,rat_arrival_number as a new column in table 1. and a duplicate record for them in case we take 2 record:  bat_landing_number2,food_availability2,rat_minutes2,rat_arrival_number2
# example table 1 after joining the 2 datasets: start_time,bat_landing_to_food,habit,rat_period_start,rat_period_end,seconds_after_rat_arrival,risk,reward,month,sunset_time,hours_after_sunset,season,bat_landing_number,food_availability,rat_minutes,rat_arrival_number,bat_landing_number2,food_availability2,rat_minutes2,rat_arrival_number2

?????   we concluded that the merging is correct by checking rat_period_start and rat_period_end then comparing it to rat time 1 + rat time 2

every bat landing happened, there was at least 1 rat present in the 30 min recording (in dataset1)

There is no instance where rat_period_start was more than (>) start_time

avg_food_availability, avg_bat_landing_number, avg_rat_arrival_number, sum_rat_minutes are calculated in case the bat appeared in 2 recordings instead of 1

We realised that when habit is "rat" the risk is always 1 and 'pick' is always 0, 100% of the time, so the habit discribes the type of the risk/situation

TREND ANALYSIS:

Statistical significance: highly significant (p < 0.001)
Confidence level: 99.9%
Trend interpretation: Weak-to-moderate increasing trend over time
Effect size (R²): 5.8% of variance explained by time
Practical meaning: Bat landing time increases by 0.027 seconds per observation


Avoidance: We can use the seconds_after_rat_arrival variable to measure avoidance. A longer delay between the rat's arrival and a bat's landing may indicate avoidance behavior.

Vigilance: We can use the bat_landing_to_food variable to measure vigilance. A longer delay between the bat's landing and its approach to the food platform may indicate increased caution or a higher state of vigilance.


seconds_after_rat_arrival vs avg_rat_arrival_number to see whether or not the rat take longer time to land if there are more rats



per avg_rat_arrival_number level for boxplot of bat_landing_to_food:
  avg_rat_arrival_number=1: n=505
  avg_rat_arrival_number=2: n=232
  avg_rat_arrival_number=3: n=87 



????? In contrast, earlier results showed seconds_after_rat_arrival increases with rat activity (avoidance). Together: bats delay landing when rats are active (avoidance), but once they land, they approach the food at a similar speed regardless of how many rats are present (no added vigilance).




we create a new column in the dataset called "motivation" based on food_availability/avg_rat_arrival_number=motevation.

and another "decision time" based on seconds_after_rat_arrival+ bat_landing_to_food


we will compare motivation to motivation and decision time when habit is related to RAT and risk = 1
