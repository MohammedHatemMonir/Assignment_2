DATASET1.CSV - DATA PARAMETERS AND THEIR DATA TYPES
==================================================
A team of zoologists studied the foraging behaviour of the Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in
the presence of Black Rats (Rattus rattus). They set out to conduct a series of observations in a semi-
natural, open bat colony over a 7-month period, where the interactions of both animals’ on a provisioned
food platform were monitored using surveillance video cameras. The outcome of these observations was
then collated into two datasets.

Lets first tackle the first dataset.

QUICK REFERENCE LIST:
====================
start_time: "DateTime"
bat_landing_to_food: "Numeric"
habit: "Categorical"
rat_period_start: "DateTime"
rat_period_end: "DateTime"
seconds_after_rat_arrival: "Numeric"
risk: "Binary"
reward: "Binary"
month: "Numeric"
sunset_time: "DateTime"
hours_after_sunset: "Numeric"
season: "Numeric"

he first dataset focuses on what happens each time a bat lands on a provisioned food platform when
rats are present. Each row in this dataset is a unique, single bat landing on the food platform. It further
describes the situational context and a bat’s observed behaviours following its landing.
The zoologists manually detected each bat landings from the collected surveillance video footage, as
previously described. Behavioural variables such as vigilance and foraging success of each landing were
then manually annotated and quantified by watching the video recordings. Table 1 explains the meaning
of variables in this dataset


Column
No.
Variable Name Description
1 start_time Bat’s landing time on the food platform
2 bat_landing_to_food Time difference (in seconds) after a bat’s landing and before it started
to approach the food on the platform
3 habit The context surrounding the landing event and the animals’ behaviour
4 rat_period_start The time rat(s) arrived on the food platform
5 rat_period_end The time rat(s) left the food platform
6 seconds_after_rat_arrival Time difference (in seconds) since rats’ arrival until the bat landed
7 risk Indicates a risk-taking behaviour, such as attacking rats to gain access
to food or not, as determined by the zoologist
(0: risk-avoidance; 1: risk-taking)
8 reward Whether the demonstrated behaviour is rewarding
(0: no reward; 1: reward)
9 month Month label assigned by the zoologists
10 sunset_time Sunset time of the day
11 hours_after_sunset Time difference (in hours) since sunset until the observed landing
12 season Season label assigned by the zoologists

NOTES:
- Some cells contain empty values (especially in the 'habit' column)
- The 'bat_landing_to_food' column contains both very small decimal values and larger integer values
- DateTime columns are stored as strings and would need parsing for temporal analysis
- Binary columns (risk, reward) use 0/1 encoding
- Some unusual entries exist (like coordinates in one 'habit' cell: "94.0,305.0,239.0,416.0; 364.8,139.3,462.3,241.3")

IMPORTANT CORRELATIONS:
======================

1. bat_landing_to_food vs seconds_after_rat_arrival
   - Reveals how bat response time changes based on when they arrive relative to rats
   - Key insight: Understanding competitive timing strategies

2. hours_after_sunset vs bat_landing_to_food  
   - Shows temporal patterns in bat foraging behavior throughout the night
   - Key insight: Identifying peak activity periods and behavioral changes over time

3. risk vs bat_landing_to_food
   - Demonstrates how risk-taking behavior affects bat landing and approach patterns
   - Key insight: Risk assessment strategies and trade-offs in foraging decisions

4. reward vs bat_landing_to_food
   - Reveals the relationship between rewarding outcomes and bat response behavior
   - Key insight: Learning and adaptation patterns in foraging success

5. seconds_after_rat_arrival vs risk
   - Shows how timing relative to rat presence influences risk-taking decisions
   - Key insight: Temporal dynamics of competitive interactions and decision-making



WHAT I DO NOT KNOW:

- if we need to do more graphs like "Distributions of Data" Histogram
- If we need to use Z score
- If we need to use p-value
