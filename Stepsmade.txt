First step made is taking a look at the Data
In data set 1 we found that:
-No missing values except in habit (41 missing).
-Datetime columns (start_time, rat_period_start, rat_period_end, sunset_time) are still object (strings). We need to parse them.
-907 total rows
- visualize habits and check how many habits have risk and how many do not
-over the time, where habit is "rat" compare the bat_landing_to_food
